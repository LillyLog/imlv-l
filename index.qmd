# Introduction

## Project Overview

This report is an analysis of traffic congestion patterns in New York City through interpretable machine learning methods. Traffic congestion is a significant challenge in major cities like NYC, affecting daily commutes, emergency response times, economic activity, and environmental quality. Using methods SHAP, LIME, and feature importance metrics, I aim to gether insights into the factors that influence traffic patterns in New York City.

## Research Questions
The primary questions this analysis seeks to answer include:

1. What are the key factors that affect traffic congestion in NYC?
2. Do different interpretability methods (SHAP, LIME, feature importance) identify consistent factors?
3. How stable are these interpretations across different model types and data splits?
4. Could these insights eventually inform policy decisions related to traffic management?

## Data Sources

This analysis integrates multiple data sources:

- **Traffic Volume Data**: Traffic count data from NYC Department of Transportation: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Automated-Traffic-Volume-Counts/7ym2-wayt/about_data
- **Weather Data**: Historical temperature and precipitation information: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/city/time-series/USW00094728/tavg/12/0/2013-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=2013&endbaseyear=2020
- **Emergency Response Data**: Response time metrics as indicators of road network performance: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/911-Open-Data-Local-Law-119/gpny-cuvw/about_data

## Methodology

I followed these steps: 

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned, integrated, and feature engineered the data
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualized and statistically analyzed the traffic patterns
3. **Model Development**: Trained multiple machine learning models to predict traffic volumes
4. **Interpretability Analysis**: Applied and compared SHAP, LIME, and feature importance techniques
5. **Stability Analysis**: Assessed the robustness of interpretations across different conditions
